## Unveiling Fake Accounts at the Time of Registration: An Unsupervised Approach

Design UFA, an unsupervised method, to detect fake accounts at the time of registration. UFA can overcome limitations of existing fake account detection methods. Specifically, UFA consists of four components:

- unsupervised weight learning; 
- registration graph construction; 
- fake account detection;
